# Mlops_Breast_Cancer_Fighter

This project objective is to find the person  is afftected by breast cancer (Maligant) or not affected (Benign)

The repository named mlops_breast_cancer_fighter due to the reason we tried to implement the mlops objective over to it

## The below pointers were tried respective to mlops.

1. we are building the report for feature engineering and model report where stated confusion matrix and accuracy loss (requesting here to add more details by my colloborator @Rushikesh Naik... )
2. Also this project will build the results as pie chart ,stating the percentage the given users are affected by breast cancer vs not affected

# To do:

1. Planing to built the inference script, where can give result/report custom dataset for evaluation
2. Built webapp/Dashbaord via flask application to display these outputs , when the users upload the data
